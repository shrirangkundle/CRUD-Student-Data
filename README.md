# CRUD-Student-Data

MERN (Mongo,React,Express,Node) has been used to create this application.

There are 2 main folders

Front-end
Back-end

To run the application you have to navigate to both the folders and install the dependencies
in back-end folder MONGO URI is stored in .env file which you have to create and paste this :

MONGO_URI = mongodb+srv://shri1003:<password>@nodeexpressprojects.yena0.mongodb.net/myrsa-technology?retryWrites=true&w=majority

please reach out to shrirangkundle10@gmail.com or my phone no. 9039700474 for the mongopass otherwise the Mongo wont be connected

after that execute npm start in both front-end and back-end to start the application

There may be CORS issue where the data is not fetched properly from the API, In that case install Moesif CORS chrome plugin
